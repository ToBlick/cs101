# Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 0101-004)

Slide presentations used to teach basic computer science concepts, largely focused on object-oriented programming.

This repository and all its content is based on [Amos Bloomberg's](https://knowledge.kitchen/me/cv/) [Intro To Computer Science](https://github.com/nyu-java-programming/course-materials). Many thanks to him and Daniel Zink. You can check for updates to this site on its [repository](https://github.com/ToBlick/cs101-spring24).

## Deployed site

View the [schedule](https://toblick.github.io/cs101-spring24/schedule/) and [syllabus](https://toblick.github.io/cs101-spring24/syllabus/), which contain links to all deployed course materials.

## Running locally

The code in this repository is used to generate the course website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and continuously deploy it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It is possible to run the website locally on your own machine.

- Assuming [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is installed...
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) globally
- Install the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` by running the command, `bundle`.
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve` or simply `jekyll serve` if that doesn't work.
