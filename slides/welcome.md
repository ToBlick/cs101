## This course

Introduction to Computer Science

- Syllabus: [syllabus](../../syllabus)
- Schedule: [schedule](../../schedule)

---

Official description:

> How to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs. Experience is acquired through projects in a high-level programming language. Intended primarily for computer science majors but also suitable for students of other scientific disciplines. Programming assignments.

---


> I shall use the word programming to denote the whole activity of design and implementation of programmed solutions. What I am concerned with is the activity of matching some significant part and aspect of an activity in the real world to the formal symbol manipulation that can be done by a program running on a computer.
>
> – [Peter Naur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur), Programming as Theory Building (1985)

> I’m personally convinced that computer science has a lot in common with physics. Both are about how the world works at a rather fundamental level. The difference, of course, is that while in physics you’re supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science you create the world.
>

## You

- Probably an aspiring programmer.
- Perhaps an aspiring computer scientist.
- Hopefully interested in making things and solving problems.
- Willing to spend hours by yourself reading and staring at code.

---

# Some key concepts ahead

- Data types: integers, floats, lists, ...
--
- Representing numbers in memory
--
- Control flow: if/else, loops, boolean logic
--
- Object-oriented programming
--
- Compilers, interpreters, assemblers
--
- Deep and shallow copies
--
- Abstraction layers, interfaces
--
- Recursion

---

# You can place out of this class

If you are comfortable with multi-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, and recursion, consider taking a placement exam to skip this course.

See the [placement exams](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/placement_sample_exams.html).

# How this course works

---


## Lecture

I will speak for 75 minutes about twice each week.... that's 150 minutes of talking each week.

--

Please do interrupt me and ask questions. Lectures are more effective when they are not a monologue.

---


## Notes

There are notes for most lecture topics by [Amos Bloomberg](https://knowledge.kitchen/). They are very useful but they are under construction.

---

## Slides

The slides are available on the [schedule](../../schedule). The slides are more of a table of contents of the lecture and are not meant to replace a textbook or the example code.

---


## Reading

There are many resources available in the form of textbooks, blog articles, the [java docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/), video tutorials, ....

See what works best for you.

---


## Assignments

You will have somewhere around 7 assignments.

Extensions are available on request.

---


## Quizzes

There will be multiple-choice online quizzes. These are meant to help you practice and do not influence your grade.

In-class quizzes are there for you to check your knowledge before the exams. You will have an idea of when they will take place.

---


## Exams

You will take 3 exams.

---


## Practice

This course is a bit like a mix between a language class and a math class.

A lot of it is "learning by doing". The vast majority of your exam prep should be writing code and working on coding problems. I do not plan to ask you memorization questions. You will be allowed a sheet of notes in exams and quizzes.

--

Practice problems can be found
- in the [corresponding repo](https://github.com/ToBlick/cs101-examples/tree/main), along with my exams from previous semesters
- on online programming learning platforms (these are very popular for anyone practicing for interview questions)
- by asking your favorite LLM to generate you some
- by talking to your fellow students

---


## Grading

- 10% assignments
- 20% in-class quizzes
- 20% first exam
- 20% second exam
- 30% third exam

---


## How tough is this course?

Programming can feel very binary: things work or they do not. This can be both very rewarding and very frustrating.

--

On a scale from 1 (easy) to 5, the course is usually rated 4 - 5 in previous semesters. Note that these are ratings from those students who did not end up dropping the course.

--

The exams are challenging. The idea behind this is that small errors, "typos" and oversights do not drag down your grade much.

---


## Communication

Announcements concerning the course will be posted on Brightspace. There is also a discussion forum there. You can always talk to me before or after class. If you want to meet outside of those times, please reach out via email.

---


## Tutoring

Tutors are available to answer your questions and help you with anything related to the course.

The tutoring schedule is released on Brightspace.

# What to do now

---

# What to do now

## Check the syllabus

The [syllabus](../../syllabus) contains basic information on how this course works.

---

# What to do now

## Bookmark the schedule

The [schedule](../../) contains a day-by-day breakdown of everything you need to know and do in this course.

---

# What to do now

## Download JDK

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a necessary set of tools that help develop Java programs. Install the Standard Edition (SE) Version 17. Assignments will be tested against Java 17.

---

# What to do now

## Install a shell

- Windows (WSL):
 - [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
 - If using VSCode: [Set VSCode to use WSL Bash](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/tips-and-tricks-for-linux-development-with-wsl-and-visual-studio-code/#setting-the-default-shell)
- alternatively: Windows (Git)
 - [Install Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
 - To set Git Bash up in VSCode [the second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) by **Mahade Walid** and edited by **FruityOatyBar** (ignore the first answer, which is outdated).
- Linux and Mac users already have a UNIX command shell in the form of the terminal.

It is a good idea to get accustomed to LLM/AI tools without becoming fully dependent on them. You won't have access to an LLM during exams.
