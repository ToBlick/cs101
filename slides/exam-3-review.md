# Prior Knowledge

--

## Cumulative by nature

By nature of the material, the exam will include all contents we have covered this semester.

---

name: part0

# Part 0:

- Representation of numbers. What is a bit, what is a byte? Floating point numbers. 
- Basic Unix (not as much as in midterm one).
- Compiled and interpreted languages. Advantages/disadvantages. How does Java fit into this picture?

---

name: part1

# Part 1:

- Java types.
- Branching and control flow. `if/else/switch/case`.
- Declaring and using methods. Keywords. Signatures. Scope of a variable. Overloading.
- Arrays. Passing references or values to methods. 
- Multidimensional arrays. Does Java have them? Arrays of arrays and how to use them. Implications for speed and memory usage (see 'batching' problem). Ragged arrays.
- `ArrayList` and why it is needed (you do not need to memorize/bring the method signatures).

name: part2

# Part 2:

- OOP. Abstraction. Writing re-usable code. Encapsulation and black boxes.
- What is a class? What is an object? Constructors. Methods and properties. Keywords (`public, private, protected, static, final, ...`). Getters and setters and why we use them.
- Reference types and shared data. When should one make a (deep) copy, when is a reference enough?
- Inheritance. Composition. Using `super()`. Overriding methods.
- Polymorphism. Casting. `instanceof`. Batch processing.
- Abstract classes. Abstract methods. 
- Interfaces. Default methods. Implementing multiple interfaces. Limitations of interfaces.
- Examples of all of the above. Why is the polymorphism concept so important? What can and cannot be instantiated?
- Exception handling. Errors vs. exceptions. Unchecked and checked exceptions. `try/catch/finally` and `throws`.
- Recursion
- Sorting: Insertionsort, Mergesort, Quicksort
